# Link-U-OS

## Project Goals

This project aims to build an open robot development ecosystem with the following core features:
- **OS Minimal Subsystem** - Provides a lightweight operating system foundation
- **Motion Control Module** - Contains models and model training code
- **Motion Control Simulation Testing** - Provides extensions and robot deployment (A2) toolchain
- **A2 Secondary Development Capabilities** - Supports secondary development capabilities including actuator protocol standards, actuator and data acquisition/motion distribution extension processes

## Project Advantages

### 🎯 **Multi-level User Coverage**
- Supports **developers with A2 robots** for physical development and validation
- Supports **learners without A2 robots** for learning and experimentation through simulation environments
- Welcomes **ecosystem partners** for collaborative development based on the OS ecosystem

### 🔧 **Complete Development Toolchain**
- **Standardized Development Environment** - Unified development and compilation environment with one-click deployment scripts, eliminating environment configuration differences and lowering development barriers
- **Modern Build System** - Based on Bazel and other tools supporting multi-platform compilation, integrated with intelligent dependency management to ensure version compatibility
- **Simulation Environment**: Training source code based on MuJoCo and Isaac Gym/Lab
- **Physical Deployment**: Supports complete deployment process from simulation to physical robots
- **Flexible Extension**: Provides secondary development capabilities including actuator extension and motion control framework replacement

### 🌐 **Open Source Ecosystem**
- Fully open source, lowering the barrier to robot development
- Supports flexible choice between commercial and open source software versions
- Builds an active developer community to promote technical exchange and innovation

### 📦 **Modular Architecture**
- Replaceable motion control framework
- Extensible system software
- Flexible secondary development interfaces
